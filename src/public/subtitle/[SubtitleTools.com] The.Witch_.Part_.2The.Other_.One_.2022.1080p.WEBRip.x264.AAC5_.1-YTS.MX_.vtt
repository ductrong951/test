00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.240
My child.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.030
Come to me.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.830
Come to Mommy.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.960
Hurry.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Come to me.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.090
Come to me, my child.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.060
Let's all sing together.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.149
Don't hate your friends.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.689
Just once in my life.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.990
Let's go on a long voyage.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.660
Love each other, my friend.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.449
Be happy, my friend.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.250
Is the tape jammed?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.056
Do you want me to untie it
for you want me to untie you?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.919
No, I'm fine.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.250
I'll do it in a minute.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.169
Let's just use the MP3.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.840
Who listens to Walkman now?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.680
It's all going to be broken by you.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.640
Try this.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.050
It's delicious.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.430
Delicious, isn't it?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.639
Delicious.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640
Delicious, isn't it?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
That one.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.519
What did you do last night?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.770
Why have you been sleeping?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440
Hey.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.200
You sleep with Jae-hyun last night.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.950
Isn't that right?

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.360
What are you talking about?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.119
Am I right?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.780
Hello?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.500
Look me in the eye.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.079
I'm sure you did.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.079
Stop it.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.460
All right, I won't say it.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.760
Having fun?

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.550
All night-Oh, my God.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.679
I really won't.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.180
I really won't.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.880
Don't worry about it. Don't...

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.300
That guy's been like that
ever since the beginning.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.140
That pervert.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.920
Where are we?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.340
My neck.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.560
- Are you on the wrong track?
- Where are we?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.070
Where are we?

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.159
I don't think it's here.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.660
Nothing.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.120
Chief, is this the right place?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.569
The sightseeing bus fell under the bridge.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.830
Bodies found in damaged buses.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.790
The windows are broken. There's
luggage and wreckage everywhere.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.010
The condition of the damaged vehicle shows
what happened in the event of an accident.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.099
A bus that fell from a
twenty-one meter cliff,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.060
has been damaged,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.770
carrying 36 people on board.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.819
The bus was going downhill

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.160
when it hit a guardrail
and fell into a stream.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.039
It's because the slope is too steep.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.580
You woke up too early.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.540
Don't be afraid.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.340
Nothing's gonna happen.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.220
My child.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.010
I have a baby in my belly.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.770
I know.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.770
It's a girl.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.350
This kid will have a brother.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.230
They'll be twins.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.150
The twins will have
countless brothers and sisters.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.500
We'll make it.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.840
What do you mean?

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.930
Girl, it looks like you really
don't know who you are.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.270
Or are you pretending?

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.400
It doesn't matter.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.360
You probably don't know.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.360
We're with you.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.920
The place where my aunt lives is good.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.740
That's nice.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.550
What's that?

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.090
Where did that come from?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.740
That's what happens when you
come to the old woman's house.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.500
General manager,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.670
The view here is amazing.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.470
How did you find this place?

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.640
I should've stopped by
more often to say hello.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.980
I shouldn't have missed you so long.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.310
You must be busy taking
over so many new jobs.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.560
It doesn't matter.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.360
I can't believe I've
drawn so many pictures.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.950
You drew all of this yourself, didn't you?

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.739
Don't you want to hold a solo show?

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.120
It's a shame to leave the ashes like this.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.370
I heard there was an accident in the lab.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.300
Yeah, early this morning.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.170
You're being too direct.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:06.140
It's not like there's a
problem with headquarters.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.270
Yes, we do.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.480
We got a little problem
at the lab headquarters.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.270
No, it's not.

00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:14.400
It's not a small problem.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.280
It's the headquarters that's been breached.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.120
Talking to you, who is already retired,
about these problems

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.580
is a little inappropriate.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.620
But you were in charge.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.700
There are some things
that you still need to know.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.710
Who could have done this?

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:40.710
It's not related to the previous
generation's problem, is it?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.590
Why do you ask?

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.550
Chief,
your bad taste is still the same as always.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.140
You're right.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:59.070
After this group of rubbish destroyed the
laboratory, it was scattered all over the place.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.910
Chief, aren't you curious about that?

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.620
Who let those dolls out?

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.790
What's their purpose?

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.800
Only a small number of people in the foundation
know about the existence of the laboratory.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.510
There are only two organizations
I can think of right now.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.929
The Superhumanist organization,

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.140
and the Alliance.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.600
So it's not on our side.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.480
It's on your side, the chief executive.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.650
Right?

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:49.690
We should investigate
to find out right away.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.119
No, we won't.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.250
We don't have time to
investigate our current situation.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.880
It's been breached.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.629
But from our point of view,

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.970
it's an internal breakthrough,
not an external one.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.470
What do you mean?

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.560
Yes.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.400
The child was lost.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.569
Not abandoned but lost?

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.200
Yes, the child was lost.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.330
She walked out on his own.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.130
It's over.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.190
What's the matter with you?

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.230
Where are you going?

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.360
Want a ride?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.700
You son of a bitch,
why don't you answer the question?

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.950
What are you doing? Get in the car!

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.970
What are you doing?

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.060
What are you doing?

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.849
She's got nothing to
do with it. Why take her?

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.520
Are you a humanitarian?

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.650
Isn't this the time for
you to worry about others?

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.150
We might have to bury you.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.110
How can we leave witnesses?

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.580
We do things very rigorously.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.040
How could she be so virtuous?

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.000
Is the blood on her body real?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.460
Hyung, it looks like it's real blood.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.129
What the hell does she do?

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.760
Let her go.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.469
She didn't see anything.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.810
You're so noisy.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.430
She saw this car.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.390
I think she even saw the license plate.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.309
Cut the crap.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.230
If it were you, could you see it?

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.650
That's not necessarily true.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.940
41 River 0115.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.990
Did you really see that?

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.870
How did you see that?

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.499
What else did you see?

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.460
010－7562－3905

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.000
702, 309 Pillar Rock Building.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.510
It's okay, hyung. This is a set car.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.520
Who the hell are you?

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.190
Do you live here?

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.279
Boss is asking you a question,
son of a bitch!

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.110
What the hell are you doing?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.030
Let her go.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.910
Stinky woman, shut up!

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.750
Gun.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.580
You bastards!

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.540
Don't bully innocent children.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.509
Stinky woman, shut up and be quiet!

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.549
What the hell are you doing?

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.890
What's wrong with you?

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.220
Be honest with me, little brat.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520
Let go.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.769
What the hell does this girl do?

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.770
Let go.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.069
It's not the crazy guy who lives here.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.070
Hyung, I think she's really crazy.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.570
Right?

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.579
She's wearing a mental hospital suit,
isn't she?

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.580
Let go of me!

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.480
Don't.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.900
Stop it!

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.910
Don't do this.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.540
You don't have to do it.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.560
Hello, this is 119. May I help you?

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.820
Please speak.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.440
Hello?

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.869
What's the matter?

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.870
Please speak.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.790
Hello?

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.660
Hello.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.590
Please don't hang up.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.470
Come with me.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.080
Yes, sir.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.580
A little further down the street.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.250
An ambulance just passed in front of me.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.050
It's not that way. It's the second way.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:13.260
Yeah, that's it.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.510
Wait a minute. I'm coming out.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.980
Uncle!

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.480
Uncle!

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.740
Kyung-hee, who the hell did this?

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.500
Yongdu, is that the bastard Yongdu?

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.670
Uncle, we have to go. Come on, come on.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.750
Let's go.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.630
But who is she?

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.000
That one.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.720
Looks like she's seriously injured.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720
Huh? Nose bleed?

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.300
That one.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.140
Hey!

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.020
Hey!

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.140
I'm serious.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.560
Uncle, come on.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.310
What the hell is going on?

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360
Are you all right?

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.190
Get in the car.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.230
All right, good.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.590
It's true.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.970
Kyung-hee.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.010
Yes, sir.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:47.060
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.480
I'm fine.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.820
But that son of a bitch, Yongdu,

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.650
is now openly harming people.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.860
That bastard should have a grudge.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.490
How long has your father been dead?

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.080
So far, we haven't taken the land.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.000
The bidding for the resort is already set.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.250
In that case,

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.170
the subordinates are also the shareholders.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.630
I'm ashamed of myself in front of them.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.880
How's the kid?

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:22.850
What she said,

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:30.440
was something that
feels particularly strange

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:35.780
but not so strange.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.190
What?

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.160
No, no, it should be fine.

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:46.040
No matter how amateur I was,

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.210
I used to be a man
flying all over the street.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.920
When I was a kid,
I saved your dad many times with this hand.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:01.550
But don't you have to call the police?

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.930
Her wounds are unusual.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.440
It always feels like a girl with a story.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.610
That's why I'm even more
afraid of calling the police.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.070
Well, that's true.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.990
It's not good for us to
associate with the police.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.660
And it's hard to explain the situation.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.300
I'll take care of her
until she gets better.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.510
Yeah, just do it.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.929
are you all right?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.090
Why are you shooting again?

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.220
Scared the hell out of me, motherfucker!

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.479
How many fucking times do i have to tell you.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.270
I can hear you fine with these
receivers. You don't need to yell!

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.109
I'm just finishing up with a smoke.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.280
Send in the clean-up crew

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:15.450
Fuck! Come on, Chief.

00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:16.771
Are you gonna do this every time?

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.039
If you keep insisting on going alone,
you're gonna die.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.419
Do you have a death wish or something?

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.709
You should have waited for me.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.090
You plan on keeping us without backup?

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.760
Then you should have hauled ass.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.930
I need to wrap up before
the church members show up.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:31.890
What?

00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:33.986
Chief, you're the one who's
setting the meeting time.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.520
Yeah, yeah. Shut up and just go.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.019
Not this son of a bitch.
Why is he so noisy?

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.770
What's that?

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.340
Why are you talking shit about me?

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.899
Why are using Korean?

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.320
What's wrong with a Korean speaking Korean?

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.990
It's nothing. You're just fucking loud.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.490
You still have that notebook around.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.740
What happened to the iPad I gave you?

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.160
I'm old-fashioned.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.460
I don't need the latest gadget.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.749
Then give back the iPad.
You don't even use it!

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.960
And that was the latest model.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.300
This motherfucker is really-

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.509
Don't be an Indian giver.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.259
And I use it, I do.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.930
For what? I've never seen you use it once.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.679
To watch Netflix before I sleep.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.440
Fucking Netflix? I've been paying
a big money for that. Fucking waste.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.770
Whatever. It's been put to good use.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.190
Shut up and just go.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.320
This fucking bastard..

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.506
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.370
Kaesaeki? That's a curse word right?

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:38.330
Kaesaeki? That's a curse word right?

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.330
That's the F word, right?

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.999
Yeah, that's a swear word.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.750
F word again!

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:42.710
F word! F word!

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.870
Guns stepped on the accelerator again.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.380
You're swearing as usual.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.600
Hey, I told you not to drink in your mouth.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.930
What are the glasses for?

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.310
I think I use it when I drink.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.520
Hey, boy, boy.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:21.990
What's wrong with you?

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.780
Is that Yongdu?

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.040
No, it's not.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.920
He's my brother's brother.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.500
It's okay. It's okay.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.710
Don't do that.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.510
Let go of me, boy.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760
You son of a bitch.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:48.930
Looks good.

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.220
But who is she?

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.810
She's the sister I know.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.650
She'll be staying with us soon.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.310
How long have you been in Korea?

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.990
Do you have a sister already?

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.700
I didn't know you were a cow.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.240
It's like a cow.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.170
Have you eaten yet, boy?

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.340
I'll fix you dinner too.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.470
Bad boy.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.650
Let's get dinner ready.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.750
What's the matter? You
don't have an appetite?

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.610
It's not that I don't have an appetite,
it's not delicious.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.130
He's a real kid.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.010
Then don't eat it.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.350
If you say it's not delicious,
you still put the food in your mouth.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.020
Is it because of the taste?

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.020
I just eat to survive.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.690
I'm really tired of this kid.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.980
It hurts.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.940
Of course it hurts i'm beating you .

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.990
You unkind to your sister recently.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:29.820
Don't Talk back, kid.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:30.700
Or else I'll step on your nose and face.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.490
I said it hurts. Don't do this.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.660
Don't do this.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.450
Don't do this.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.660
Can't you make anything that doesn't taste bad?

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.620
Just heat up the instant rice.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.290
I bought soup at the supermarket.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:44.250
You need to be cleaned up today.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:45.920
You impolite son of a bitch.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.420
Don't talk back, kid.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.470
Don't do that. What are you doing?

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:50.130
Let go kid.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:50.970
I said don't do this.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:51.510
Let go kid.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.590
I said don't do this.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.230
Now you are.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.150
Did you just push me?

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.440
I asked if you attacked your sister.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.320
I'm so sick of it.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.150
What?

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.280
I hate this house. Why did you run away?

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.466
You didn't come back until he died.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.410
What are you talking about?

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:15.620
You know you're funny?

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.950
You're the one who said
you hated running away.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.120
You said you didn't want to see Dad,
so you ran away.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.870
My father's land.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.210
When did you ever care so much about Dad?

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:26.340
Since when is this your home?

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.760
This is my room when I was a kid.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.810
You can stay here

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:43.500
This one.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.540
I think so.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:48.750
Put it on.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.340
This will be more comfortable

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.640
Then rest.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.220
Tell me if you need anything.

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:09.270
That one.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.110
I forgot to thank you.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.650
Thank you.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.200
Thanks to you, I survived.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.380
Get some rest.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.260
Get some rest.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.710
The official name of the
experiment is lab data point.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:19.760
It's written as ADP for convenience.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.470
It's going to take more than 40 years.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.720
Children are benchmarked for this project.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.280
That's what my sister and
the superhumanists wanted.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:45.830
A complete version of the model.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:52.170
They've been looking
for it for a long time.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.460
Separating the ontogenetic genes

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:57.750
and attempting to reproduce it.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.930
One of them is this kid.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:16.070
Koo Ja-yoon is still missing?

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.710
All I know is that after leaving here,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.030
she showed up at the last lab last month.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.740
The chief let go of the
children he had found.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.200
Actually, I was a little surprised.

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:37.500
She's better than I expected.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.630
But Ja-yoon was also traumatized here.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.180
So it's supposed to be
inoperable for a while.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:50.560
And she has weaknesses.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.100
Her brain depends on drugs.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.150
She can't do much harm to us all by herself.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.480
But this kid's different, isn't she?

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.240
I don't know what kind
of monster it will be.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.080
It's always hard to predict.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.710
It must be removed.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.630
If the company knows about this,

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.300
both the chief and I are fucked.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.656
It's supposed to break up our heads.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.220
It's used as a base for experiments.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.310
I see what you mean.

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:40.570
Think of it as paying off
my debt from 10 years ago.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.650
Then I'll go.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.950
Just in case,
they planted chips in the lab kids.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.596
It keeps track of the state of the brain.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.620
There's still room.

00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:56.960
It'll help you find her.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.670
But this one doesn't seem to work.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.380
How do I use it?

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.510
Do you know how to use this?

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:09.760
What?

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:11.430
It's almost broken.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.770
Stop licking.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.020
It's dirty.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.440
Chief, you really think we should be doing this ?

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.110
I mean...

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.160
An un official operation .. when or numbers are already down

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:35.450
And besides ...kinda sound like its a key asset of the company.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:36.750
You a pussy?

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:37.370
No

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:38.710
Then just go home.

00:53:38.711 --> 00:53:41.750
I mean ... just wondering Chief, aren't you worried ?

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.090
You heard what Baek said said?

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.379
And I know what those archives can do

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.010
I was there 10 years ago.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.219
They're savage monsters.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.469
But in all seriousness Chief

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.430
Ya ya .. shut up

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.390
Those guys are starting to get to me

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.190
Haa ... i fuckin' knew it

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.440
They've been on our tail since we got to Korea

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:05.610
So what?

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:06.240
Get them

00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:07.320
Hold on.

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:43.730
What is it?

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:23.480
Think they're local agents ?

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.820
...calm the fuck down

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:35.989
We're not looking for any trouble

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:37.700
We didn't even know you guys worked here.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:40.000
Can't we all just get along, huh

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.670
Look look look ... .

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.170
What are you talking about?

00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.810
Well thats not a very friendly hello

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.930
Is this really necessary ?

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.750
Come on gents

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:22.850
Tell your boss to come and see me.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.390
There's a bus card. It's
right in front of the bus stop.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.480
Let's go back.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.870
What is it now, just say it.

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:48.540
Chief, err so you know their boss ?

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.630
Too well

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:55.170
You're ex Boss ... I take it ?

00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.220
Yes,

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.470
that was ten years ago.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.219
Sounds like theres some issue there

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.600
Well, thats a relief, eh ?.

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.350
Yes, releif

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:12.690
Huh ... why do you say that ?

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.320
Uhm..

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:14.570
Don't know

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.360
Why ?

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:17.360
Didn't you work for the other team ?

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.150
Yes.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.580
Wait, so does that mean ...IIII

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:25.370
Was a girl ?

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.540
Sick ya?

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.039
Don't go crazy on me again.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.500
Fuck girl, so much swearing in Korean.

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:33.030
Are you mocking me ?.

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:33.750
Who Me?

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.670
Yes, you.

00:58:34.671 --> 00:58:36.130
No, never.

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.010
You're just in a bad mood Chief

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.140
Whre are we headed to any way Chief?

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.230
Lets take care of this first

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:52.520
Keep circling till I pick up a signal

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:56.480
Wow, soo primitive.

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:58.820
D,you have any idea how fucking big this island is ?

00:58:58.940 --> 00:58:59.530
No ?

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:00.530
I'll tell you

00:59:00.531 --> 00:59:03.739
1,833.2 square kilometers.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.700
Needle - haystack chief, haystack

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:09.870
Chief, were you even listening to ...?

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.460
My child.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:56.290
Come to Mommy.

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.510
Come on.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.260
Come to Mommy.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.490
It smells like cow dung.

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.540
We need to level this
place as soon as possible.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.250
Is that Kyung-hee?

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.720
Long time no see.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.340
I'm Yongdu.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.890
Remember me?

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.890
Stay right there.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.480
Hey, there.

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:26.610
Your father used to use it for hunting.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.489
You should keep it at the police station.

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:31.949
You can't just leave it at home.

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.320
It's illegal.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.580
By the way, you're from America.

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:38.250
America.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:42.920
It's a place full of guns anyway, isn't it?

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:47.459
But where's everybody else?

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.549
You're the only one
who's holding that thing up.

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.969
What are you talking about?

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:54.050
What kind of weapon do you carry?

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.969
Four of my men are now semi-maimed.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.720
Life is at stake.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:04.859
My men are clamoring to call the police.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.980
My uncle stopped me for a long time.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.280
Hey, Kyung-hee, are we strangers?

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:14.319
Family business has to
be handled by a family.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.830
Don't involve outsiders.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.370
That's not gonna work, you know?

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:22.250
By the way,

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.540
didn't wonderful father

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.210
teach you that?

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:31.510
I'm asking you.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:39.220
All right. All right.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.580
Well, that's all.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.459
Well, let's talk a little bit today.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:04.579
Say what?

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.829
I have nothing to say to you.

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:08.630
Hey, you've got that.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.339
Shut up.

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.510
But have you ever shot anyone?

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:23.390
Let's go.

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:26.310
Don't come near me.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.519
I told you not to come.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520
You hear me?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.610
Bring it here.

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.239
Let me go, motherfucker.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.820
- Be honest.
- Let me go.

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.160
Let me go, motherfucker.

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:41.619
I ask you to let me go!

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.290
You scared me.

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.210
You dogs!

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.459
Who's this kid?

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.710
Who are you, smelly kid?

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.290
Get out of here, motherfucker.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.379
Don't hit my brother.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.049
You fucking dog!

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.299
Hello? Hello?

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.140
Are you some kind of baseball player?

01:04:58.141 --> 01:04:59.430
- Don't hit him.
- Hey.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.600
Don't touch my brother.

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:09.610
Hyung, there's no one in there.

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:12.070
What, really nobody?

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:16.240
Hey!

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:22.030
I don't think Kyung-hee
takes my uncle seriously.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.369
You're gonna use this gun

01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.039
to get rid of all these bastards?

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.710
What kind of crap do
you keep talking about?

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:32.630
All right.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.629
After all, Chul-ho and I are loyal.

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:39.300
Let's pretend nothing
happened between our children.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:41.430
It's a thing of the past
anyway. What can we do?

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:44.349
So just sign the contract

01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.600
and put your fingerprints.

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:50.150
What the hell are you doing here?

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.650
Do you want cows or sheep?

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:55.230
Besides,
did I ask you to give it to me for nothing?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.360
I'll give you a little more
than the market price.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.700
Just take the money and go to Seoul.

01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:04.740
Why don't we go shopping and have a date?

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.960
Then I'll have a nice life with my brother.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:11.039
Now my parents are gone.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.879
You'll have to take good care of
your brother from now on, won't you?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.000
The house of Zhao,

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:16.920
I won't give it to you.

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:18.670
How many times do I have to say that?

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.430
Hello?

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:23.759
I've told you so much.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.600
Why don't you give me a sincere answer?

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.430
Why are you so bold?

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.100
Your father is dead.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.440
But what's going on now?

01:06:31.441 --> 01:06:32.560
Are you denying reality?

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.400
I know.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.440
My dad's dead.

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:39.700
Didn't you kill him?

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.370
You killed my father you bastard.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:51.290
I've been patient with you for a while,
but you don't hold back.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.540
Close her mouth.

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.630
Looks like she's gonna have to be beaten.

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:57.339
That's fine,

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.010
as long as her fingerprints are intact.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.009
Stop fighting, you bastards!

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:05.640
Let go of me!

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.060
Hey!

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:10.850
Daegil.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.809
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:14.730
Daegil.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:15.480
Stand up, you son of a bitch.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.360
Come here. Come here. Come here.

01:07:16.361 --> 01:07:17.780
Stand up, you son of a bitch.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440
Come here.

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:22.530
You son of a bitch.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.740
That son of a bitch is
getting on my nerves.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.250
Do you have to be beaten
to get your act together?

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.499
- Say it.
- Don't move, you son of a bitch.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.380
My boss is talking to you.

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:36.670
Where are you looking?

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.760
I'm scared to death.

01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:45.090
Who is she?

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.680
It's dangerous over there.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.060
Get down.

01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:51.429
Come down here and
be careful not to get hurt.

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:52.559
Hey, get down here.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.810
How did she get up there?

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:56.810
Why do kids these days have so much guts?

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:01.029
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Crazty woman.

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:03.989
Dangerous. Be careful not to fall.

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.570
What's she doing?

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.949
What are you waiting for?

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.580
Hey, hey, get down here.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:25.430
What is it?

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:26.970
The circus?

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200
What the fuck?

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:12.510
Did you just see that?

01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:13.930
What's that...

01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:19.059
Are you here to visit?

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.190
Do something about it, you bastards.

01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:30.660
Don't come near me.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:33.490
Don't come near me.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:34.950
Don't come near me.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.660
Don't come near me.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.350
Get out of here.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600
Don't come near me.

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.560
Go away! Go away!

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.700
Get out of here.

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:14.700
Go away! Go away!

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:21.670
Forget it.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.040
Forget it. It's about time.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.720
I'm all right.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.970
So stop fighting.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.230
Let's go.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.390
Don't come again.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.060
Got it?

01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.900
I'm telling you to wake up.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.280
Take your men down to the hospital.

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.700
Wake up, you son of a bitch.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.960
Okay, I'll get my act together.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.620
Let's get out of course.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.630
Go on, go on, go on.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:44.170
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.340
Hey,

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:50.460
who is she?

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.550
What did I just see?

01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:59.600
Just calm down.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:04.059
Actually, I don't know.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.310
Look at her.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560
What?

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.980
Is she really an alien?

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:13.740
It's not a cover ?

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:19.080
That was a scene from the movie.

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:20.990
How did you know her?

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.750
It's amazing.

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:24.459
That's amazing.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.330
How long will she stay at our house?

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.540
May I speak to her?

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:29.879
Should I take a video
and send it to YouTube?

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.420
I'm sure you made a profit.

01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:33.920
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:34.930
It's not you.

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:37.090
Are you okay?

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.179
Are you sure you're okay?

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.510
Ouch.

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:43.350
What's this?

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:45.979
Take it off. What are you doing?

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.480
Answer me, brat.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.689
Sister, don't do this.

01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:54.190
Can you introduce her to me again?

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.070
You really have to get
along with people like that.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.700
That's amazing.

01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:45.809
Who is this?

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:47.560
Isn't that Sergeant Cho?

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.020
Long time no see.

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:52.900
That's a good one.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:56.730
I thought they were thrown away somewhere.

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:00.650
Looks like he's got a little conscience.

01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:04.369
Is it because of faith?

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:06.239
Well, I have faith, too.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.699
And you can't throw it away anywhere.

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:09.950
It can pollute the environment.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.500
We should love the Earth.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.170
You look as good as ever.

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:18.840
You're still handsome.

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.510
As you know, these things are born.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:27.010
And you're still handsome.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:29.970
You're eyes are as sharp as ever.

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:32.980
Let's not talk about the past.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.520
What?

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.730
Yeah, all right.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.020
Well, let's forget it.

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:41.530
All right, then tell me something else.

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:47.700
Why did you come back so suddenly?

01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:51.200
I didn't think you'd ever come back.

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:53.499
You know what you're asking.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.209
Of course I know Chief called you back.

01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.840
But why did you come back?

01:15:58.670 --> 01:15:59.670
What?

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.630
Is it because of that thing?

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:04.549
Chief is in charge of that thing.

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:05.719
Now that we've relegated
to the second line,

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.590
just stay honest.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.890
Why are you doing this?

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.640
What's wrong with you?

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.600
Is that thing?

01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:16.860
Are you doubting me?

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.740
Can't say a word.

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:26.740
How dare this damned bitch suspect me?

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.449
Hey, Koo Ja Yoon, that bitch!

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.500
The last person I'm looking for is Chief.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.620
It evaporated silently after that.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.039
You think that's it?

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.379
Koo Ja-yoon looted Hoffen
Glass and Bangkok Labs,

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.880
before coming to Jeju Island.

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:45.130
And then she robbed the Shanghai lab,
you know that?

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.630
It's a high-level experiment.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.549
The drugs are all gone.

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:50.219
Plus, the lab's headquarters was stolen.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.930
How dare you suspect me?

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.690
Hey, just get out of here.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.730
If there's anything to do with that thing,

01:17:01.731 --> 01:17:02.860
It won't do you any good.

01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:05.609
I don't care about that company's group.

01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:07.490
How do I fight behind your back?

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.030
I'll take care of it. Don't get in my way.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.160
If I keep being followed,
and it gets in my way,

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.750
I'm not gonna sit back and watch.

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:20.250
Oh, my God, you're such a man

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.630
speaking in a murderous tone.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:26.839
Come on, let's not see each other again.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.390
Let's go our separate ways now.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.930
Hello, Hyun Joong.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.180
Hey stinky girl!

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.350
We haven't seen each other in 10 years.

01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:39.770
Are you sure you want to leave?

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:46.860
What else do you want?

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.030
You want to talk about 10 years ago?

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.949
Don't go. Take your time.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:54.240
Be careful when they turn the car around.

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.670
This woman

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:04.630
has a really bad temper.

01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:40.670
Are we almost there?

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.540
Around there, right?

01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:49.050
Well, it's almost there.

01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:55.300
The island isn't as small as I thought.

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:59.270
Oh, it's so boring.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.809
Hey, look at this, too.

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:07.020
It's funny in Korea. It's funny.

01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:09.650
Watch it. Watch it.

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.360
How do you always watch that?

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:16.240
What's the matter,
bitch? Don't kill yourself, will you?

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:21.080
Watch your mouth,
or I'll rip your fucking mouth off.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.430
I'm just kidding.

01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:37.560
I won't argue with her again.

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:42.190
Let's do it.

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:54.740
Let's see who wins.

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.620
What's the matter?

01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:01.160
We fought once when we were kids.

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.540
Was that when you were a kid?

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.500
What do you say?

01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:11.210
Have a fight.

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:21.180
Well, that's her.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.230
How on earth did she survive?

01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:31.319
She's got a bullet in her head.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.110
How on earth have you lived to this day?

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:39.740
Logically speaking, at this level,
you should be completely dead.

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.870
Is that right?

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:47.080
You think I made a mistake?

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:48.999
No, no, absolutely not!

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.300
How can something
happen to noona's ability?

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:53.840
That's not what I meant.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.720
I mean...

01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:16.740
One small piece of fresh meat.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.620
For the sake of your cuteness,
I'll spare you.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.580
You're right.

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:32.000
It should be cut off completely.

01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:41.970
Wait.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.060
Come on, let's eat.

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:48.640
That's a good kid.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.860
Is it good?

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:55.280
It's on the floor.

01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:57.280
What about this, Abby?

01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:58.860
Come on.

01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:01.870
What is it?

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.160
No, it's not.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.710
No, what are you doing?

01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:44.450
Hello, quack

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.290
stinky old man.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.460
Are you still acting a doctor?

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.380
You are cruel to animals.

01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:57.130
And...

01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:59.419
Didn't I say that if you'd
break the underground deal,

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.379
I'll take your hand off?

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.680
No, you didn't.

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.560
These days,

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:08.770
I really only treat cats and dogs.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.559
And it's just a prescription.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.440
I can't do the surgery anymore.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:16.940
Really?

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.030
Then your hands won't work anymore.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.700
Yongdu.

01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:32.540
No, Mr. Hyun Joong.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.420
Why are you doing this
to me all of a sudden?

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.670
I won't tell.

01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:41.090
I'm really not gonna tell your story.

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.340
Be quiet. It's so noisy.

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.260
Shut up.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.560
You should have something to say to me.

01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:51.850
Say what?

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.270
Kyung-hee's little girl.

01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:58.070
The story about the girl.

01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:03.780
You must have something to say to me alone.

01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:06.570
Right?

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.760
She's the one wanted.

01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:32.680
Looks like it.

01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:34.349
Who's the continuing owner?

01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:35.310
Did you get in touch?

01:24:35.311 --> 01:24:37.480
Yes, hyung. I got the message.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.990
Wow, that's funny.

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:47.160
It's exciting.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.300
That's it.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.010
This is Youtube where

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.639
they'll upload videos of them eating.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.800
Keep uploading.

01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:12.809
If someone clicks in to watch,

01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:13.889
and has a decent number of views,

01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:15.270
then we'll get the ads.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.939
If you get an ad,

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.899
the money will come.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.810
If you have a lot of fans,

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:24.860
I earn hundreds of
thousands of won a month.

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.660
Hey, you there?

01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.990
You're listening.

01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:35.909
Anyway,
they're just making money from eating.

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:38.999
You just have to turn it upside down once.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.129
Then we'll be rich.

01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:43.550
What's this?

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.469
Which one? This one?

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:48.300
Mixed noodles.

01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:49.470
Is it good?

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.640
It's delicious.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.810
Shall we go eat this?

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.690
Yeah, let's go eat.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.649
No, are you listening to me seriously?

01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:04.820
What's this?

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.650
Which one?

01:26:05.651 --> 01:26:07.240
Oh, hot dog.

01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:08.529
Next to it is pizza.

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:09.530
Is it good?

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.039
Hey, are you listening to me?

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.450
Are we going to eat this too?

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.209
I'll get you a hot dog later.

01:26:19.210 --> 01:26:20.790
I'll give you some pizza later.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.039
I asked if you were listening to me.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.090
What's this?

01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:27.460
Are you an eater?

01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:29.090
Why are you so greedy?

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.049
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:33.260
Forget it. Stop it.

01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:34.470
Stop it.

01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:06.420
Let's try abalone porridge.

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.920
It's on sale today.

01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:17.390
This is a little hot.

01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:20.600
Take your time.

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:00.139
Careful not to burn your hands and easy.

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.140
Hey, hey, hey.

01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:11.030
She's finished.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.440
It's all gone.

01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:22.870
Hello?

01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:29.250
Hey, Hey, hey.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.170
Hey, wait a minute.

01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:39.970
Hello?

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.570
I'm sorry. I'll do it as soon as I can.

01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:55.739
What a shame, don't eat it.

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.610
Do you have aliens in your stomach?

01:28:58.870 --> 01:29:00.989
They say I can eat whatever I want.

01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:02.409
You can eat,
but you have to eat in moderation.

01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:04.370
Is that how your planet is run?

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:06.960
Where's my sister?

01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:23.970
Hello. I'm at
Uncle's animal hospital.

01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:26.480
Uncle's a little hurt.

01:29:26.770 --> 01:29:28.520
I'm sorry I left in such a hurry.

01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:31.649
Why don't you guys have dinner first?

01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:32.900
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.330
Would you like some water?

01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:09.890
It's no use now, though.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:15.230
But that's enough to stick.

01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:19.740
Kyunghee,

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.490
That kid,

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:29.750
Just let it go. You can't be with the kid.

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:33.290
While Yongdu hasn't caused any trouble,

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.590
let the kid go.

01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:38.130
We're gonna have to hand over
the land and the house, okay?

01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:43.350
Come on, you go.

01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:45.600
Daegil should be waiting for you.

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:19.590
What?

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800
Hi, there.

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:24.679
Who are you?

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.140
Don't be so scared.

01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:29.270
Talk to us.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.189
For real ?

01:31:32.190 --> 01:31:34.190
Where have I heard all that talk?

01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:37.520
She can fly and throw you
out with her bare hands.

01:31:38.150 --> 01:31:39.360
I'm saying for real.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.360
It's a girl.

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.360
What?

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:44.910
I don't know, man.

01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:47.450
About 17, 18.

01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:50.789
I'm going, why do you want to know her age for

01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:52.620
Are you going on a blind date with her?

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:55.790
Didn't I tell you?

01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:58.960
There's only one girl.

01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:03.930
No need for that.

01:32:03.931 --> 01:32:07.470
I went and bought a couple of guns.

01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:14.890
Hello?

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:18.480
Hello?

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280
Hello?

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.150
What's with the phone?

01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:28.870
Hello?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.960
I'm ..... That's a new phone.

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.550
Close the door.

01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:11.080
But who are you?

01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:13.080
Who are we ?

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.700
You guys contacted us.

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.710
Ah, the girl is the one who..

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.580
Although it's a bit messy,
you'd better sit down first.

01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:57.210
Come on, let's talk.

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.420
Where is the girl now?

01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:09.840
You're gonna kill me if I tell
you're gonna kill me, right?

01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:10.930
No, I won't.

01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:12.430
Isn't that right?

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.350
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you.

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:25.020
But if you tell me quickly,
I won't torture you.

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.876
I was going to let you look at the
organs in your body slowly and in detail,

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:35.870
just like he did,

01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:37.250
and then I'll kill you.

01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:40.250
You haven't seen your own heart, have you?

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.500
Right?

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.290
No, I haven't.

01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:49.420
I'm not a cardiologist.

01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:52.470
You don't have to look at that.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.600
I can't even look at that's
what I'm supposed to see.

01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:02.350
But that one.

01:35:02.650 --> 01:35:06.610
I'm sure I'll be of some use.

01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:08.610
I'm sure there will be.

01:35:10.110 --> 01:35:12.409
It's a shame to just kill me

01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:14.410
I'm not a freeloader either.

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:18.539
After we talk,

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:23.079
we should be able to
figure out our interests.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.380
Isn't that right?

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:27.840
You tell me.

01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:32.930
I'll give you a present if I'm satisfied.

01:35:37.930 --> 01:35:38.969
Here, here, here.

01:35:38.970 --> 01:35:39.930
This one, this one, this one.

01:35:39.931 --> 01:35:41.680
See? See? See?

01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:44.850
She's Koo Ja-yoon, a country girl.

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.230
It's not a song.

01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:49.940
I don't think you're gonna
make it on YouTube.

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:52.650
Why don't we go on this show?

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.780
If you go,
you'll be able to explode like Koo Ja-yoon.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.910
Hey, you can't eat rice.

01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:02.910
You eat a lot, don't you?

01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.210
But I've never sung a song.

01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:07.750
Hey, you really...

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:11.630
Just go to the karaoke
and practice for a few days.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.130
Compared to this,

01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:17.470
other than picking people's
joints and throwing the car out,

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:18.800
What else would you do?

01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:21.930
Just like her, be gentle.

01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.690
Do something.

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.190
Let me get you some pizza.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.820
It's not the same size as before.

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.190
Big?

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:33.860
Can I have fried chicken
with the side dishes?

01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:35.400
And I'll give you some pasta.

01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:36.990
Spaghetti?

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.840
Are you a special?

01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:01.430
It's not that funny.

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.390
If you laugh like that..

01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:08.900
What's this? It's kind of pretty.

01:37:12.570 --> 01:37:14.280
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hey.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.280
Stop laughing.

01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:17.860
What are you doing?

01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.580
It's not like that anyway.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.450
That's going to be like this, isn't it?

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.690
Are you kidding me?

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:51.860
Right?

01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:53.770
Hey, don't do it.

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.779
Let me take a good look.

01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:57.449
Try it. Try it again.

01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:59.610
Do it right. Let me see.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.120
Try it.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.080
What?

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.460
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:18.840
You're amazing.

01:38:19.130 --> 01:38:21.970
How did you do that?

01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:24.179
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.679
You can't unplug that antenna.

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.220
The antenna cannot be pulled out.

01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:28.390
You need to watch TV.

01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:30.390
Put it down. Put it down.

01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:35.270
I'll go.

01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:36.530
That's crazy.

01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:38.320
That's amazing.

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.370
Did you destroy that star just now?

01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:46.200
Is it possible to be this crazy?

01:38:46.330 --> 01:38:49.460
Oh, that's not it.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.420
But where did you learn to say that?

01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:56.800
You have a gift.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.650
What? What? What?

01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:31.209
This is really the kid.

01:39:31.210 --> 01:39:33.210
What did you see?

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.230
She's a monster. I don't
know when she'll mutate.

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.730
If you don't want your brother dead,

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.820
just listen to me.

01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:13.070
Set your timers.

01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:15.370
The fireworks will give us about 30 minutes

01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:18.186
If you don't finish in time

01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:20.089
Cops and civilians are gonna get involved.

01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:21.590
And its gonna get real messy.

01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:23.010
Let's move

01:40:24.130 --> 01:40:24.880
But, Chief,

01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:27.139
Wont she find it odd if the girl took her brother

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.510
In the middle of the night?

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.070
What if she knows they are running away?

01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:33.560
Hopefully not. atleast for a few minutes

01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:38.110
Why aren't you going ?

01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:39.859
I 'm your backup

01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.440
Bullshit.

01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:42.690
Backingup who ?

01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:43.990
Just fucking go

01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.990
Chief

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:47.820
Chief

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.240
Chief wait up.

01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:07.460
Put glutinous rice balls on
top of the rice and stutter.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.390
What's that?

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:15.680
Really?

01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:17.600
That's funny.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.500
I think they're onto us?

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.460
I told you not to talk into my ear

01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:45.550
swearing again.

01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:47.630
Curse.

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.840
I'm going for real.

01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.850
I really want to kill you.

01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.559
That's right. Fireworks.

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.980
There's a fireworks festival today.

01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.140
What time is it?

01:41:58.230 --> 01:41:59.649
It's time.

01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:01.980
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go.

01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:06.570
Fireworks?

01:42:06.571 --> 01:42:08.110
It's so pretty.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.086
Don't you know that your
planet doesn't have it?

01:42:10.110 --> 01:42:13.410
Let's go over there. It's so beautiful.

01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:14.330
Aren't you going?

01:42:14.331 --> 01:42:15.790
Daegil.

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.160
What's the matter?

01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:23.000
Let go of her hand.

01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:24.800
Anytime now. Get ready.

01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:27.760
Secure your distance and fire as you see them.

01:42:28.590 --> 01:42:29.930
Yes captain.

01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:36.640
Sister, what's wrong with you?

01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:38.640
Run away.

01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:40.640
What are you talking
about? All of a sudden.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:42.650
I'm sorry.

01:42:44.690 --> 01:42:46.360
Run away!

01:42:50.610 --> 01:42:52.160
I'll go.

01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:58.830
What are those people doing?

01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:26.770
Chief, in the back.

01:43:27.150 --> 01:43:29.150
Theyre the Shanghai Lab toads , right ?

01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:39.540
Who are they?

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:41.869
Didn't I tell you not to come here again?

01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:43.540
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:46.840
Kyung-hee took out that pole again.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.550
But we do, too.

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.106
Whats the status inside?

01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:51.380
She's headed towards the roof.

01:43:51.670 --> 01:43:53.010
But there is a boy with her

01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.010
I'll go.

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.680
Secure it.

01:43:58.220 --> 01:43:59.220
Come on.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.680
Hey, can you see there? There.

01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:03.439
That's the main road.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.440
Can you get there in one go?

01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:06.810
Go, go, go.

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.070
I'm going to my sister's. You go.

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:13.070
Hey, there.

01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:15.110
You'll be back, won't you?

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.280
Come back when things get better.

01:44:17.410 --> 01:44:18.410
We're going to karaoke.

01:44:18.411 --> 01:44:19.660
I'll order you pizza every day.

01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:21.660
We must meet again.

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:28.670
Where's the girl?

01:44:30.090 --> 01:44:31.959
Who? What girl?

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.969
Bullshit, impolite woman.

01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:34.970
What?

01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:37.260
All right, go to hell.

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.520
Sister! Sister! My sister!

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:09.080
Sister! Sister! My sister!

01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:14.300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:16.420
Sister! Sister! Sister!

01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:21.010
Anything?

01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:22.560
No, Chief, picking up zero.

01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:24.690
Maybe we got them with the first two blows ?

01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:26.640
Anything there ?

01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:27.890
No, nothing

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:28.690
But...

01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:29.310
But what?

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.680
I see something else

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.119
Sister! Sister! Sister!

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.370
I've had enough of your family.

01:47:12.710 --> 01:47:17.670
There's a lot of kids like that,
and they're gonna have to fuck with me.

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:21.300
I'm going to fight you,
you fucking bastard.

01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:25.640
I'm gonna kill you myself, goddamn it.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.930
Why am I so sorry?

01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:32.730
Did I kill your father?

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:36.060
Hey, do you know why your father died?

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.859
He tried to kill me, but he died.

01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:39.900
You know what?

01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:44.950
I've been loyal for 15 years.

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.120
Did you know I won all
this land with my body?

01:47:50.370 --> 01:47:51.500
You don't know, do you?

01:47:54.710 --> 01:47:57.590
What are you doing
talking to this kid about?

01:47:58.050 --> 01:48:01.170
All right, you go with your sister.

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.050
What a pain in the ass!

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.679
Before I get angry, you guys go.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.680
It's not your turn to
come to such an occasion.

01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:12.270
What?

01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:13.770
Do as you please?

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.020
How can you decide for yourself?

01:48:17.650 --> 01:48:20.020
Why are you ruining my fun?

01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:57.100
IAww fuck. Did you see that?

01:48:57.190 --> 01:48:58.559
Thats some next level shit.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.400
Just fucking shoot

01:48:59.401 --> 01:49:01.400
I'll go.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.240
I'm dying.

01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.260
Hello?

01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:49.839
Run away!

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.009
Come on, let's go!

01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:53.590
Where the hell are you going?

01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:57.350
Don't make me upset. Go to hell.

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:04.020
Aww fuck Chief, not again

01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:08.400
Aww this's brand new

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.190
- I'll go.
- Oh, my God.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.530
That's how you keep
telling me to cover for me.

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:14.120
Move aside.

01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:16.910
It's brand new.

01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.250
Hello?

01:53:34.630 --> 01:53:37.880
Wow, it's you.

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.010
That's weird.

01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:46.600
I'm sure I've smashed your head.

01:53:47.850 --> 01:53:49.650
How did you survive?

01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.280
I'll take your neck off this time.

01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.140
Chief

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.480
How are they holding up?

01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:38.270
Chief, what are you doing?

01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.990
Chief he's a civilian.

01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.310
You're lucky.

01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.770
She's scared.

01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:59.480
I saw it.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:02.190
Didn't you pee?

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.500
Shit, those fuckin monsters.

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:18.540
It's quite unexpected.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.800
Is it different from what it used to be.

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:24.050
That's a bad breed, too.

01:56:58.790 --> 01:57:00.500
Always carry a spare, bitch

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.240
You son of a bitch.

01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:31.120
It does hurt.

01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:34.910
But what use does this have for us?

01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:23.170
What is it?

01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:28.840
She's ignoring us.

01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:55.870
You're alive.

01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:57.909
But...

01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:59.750
Back then and now.

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.630
She doesn't look very good.

01:59:05.130 --> 01:59:06.750
Who the hell is she?

01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:08.960
What's the big deal?

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.530
You monster.

02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:42.950
You.

02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:44.280
Finally.

02:03:58.750 --> 02:04:00.210
Long time no see.

02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:03.170
Don't mess with me.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:19.860
But do you know each other?

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:23.440
I know her

02:04:24.450 --> 02:04:25.450
How did you meet?

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:31.950
She was born to live alone
in the laboratory headquarters.

02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:35.000
She's my sister.

02:04:36.210 --> 02:04:38.380
I told you to release my sister.

02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:40.210
Who told you to kill her?

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:41.340
Jo-hyun.

02:05:00.110 --> 02:05:02.690
Ah them?

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:06.700
I sent them to you.

02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:08.410
She's from Shanghai, China.

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.869
I was a little hurt.

02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:18.830
If you mess with me, I can't handle it.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.670
That's why I asked them a favor.

02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:28.340
But I wasn't sure if it was you at first.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:31.260
You've been bullied by them.

02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:37.350
My sister can't be like that.

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:41.900
So I don't think you're
planning on leaving.

02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:47.030
But here.

02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:50.240
I feel you.

02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:56.540
It's a bit awkward all of a sudden,
isn't it?

02:05:57.670 --> 02:06:01.040
Yeah,
we're only together in Mom's womb.

02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:03.500
I was born apart.

02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:08.380
Did you just let me out?

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.800
Yes,

02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:12.140
Why ?

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:14.100
Because I need you.

02:06:16.930 --> 02:06:19.020
You need me, too.

02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.730
why would I ?

02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.820
If you want to see Mom,

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.320
I've heard of it.

02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:35.160
You and Mom's mind are connected.

02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:37.750
Mom's been looking for you, hasn't she?

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:40.620
She won't look for me.

02:06:52.050 --> 02:06:53.850
Let's go  my sister.

02:07:06.070 --> 02:07:09.940
You're treating your sister
too coldly after a long time.

02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:31.670
Are you in pain?

02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:35.050
You know what it's like?

02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:37.050
I want to save them.

02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:41.100
You can do it.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.810
But there's no way to save both.

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.650
You choose.

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:52.860
It's just that no one can
be an ordinary human being.

02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:55.160
Are you all right?

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:25.390
Wouldn't it be better to
die as a human being?

02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.730
Go to your mother with your sister.

02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:20.300
The children met in the end.

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:25.640
They'll be looking for their mother soon.

02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:35.900
How do you draw it like this?

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.950
Then let's get ready.

02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:15.020
Don't be silly! There's
colored eggs at the end.

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:31.260
Fuck ... almost died from holding my fucking breath

02:14:33.970 --> 02:14:35.180
They're gone.

02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:36.640
They're gone.

02:14:38.890 --> 02:14:39.890
Chief

02:14:41.190 --> 02:14:42.650
Chief, they're gone.

02:14:45.070 --> 02:14:46.530
Chief, they're gone.

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:50.400
Chief

02:14:52.530 --> 02:14:54.240
Captain! Captain!

02:14:57.290 --> 02:14:59.330
Chief ! Chief !

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:01.040
Chief, wake up.

02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:02.670
Chief, can you hear me?

02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:04.250
Chief

02:15:04.710 --> 02:15:07.170
What the fuck am i suppose to do without you ?

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.360
Those monsters might hear and come back.

02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:27.820
I guess they took the kids

02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:31.490
What the fuck you doing?

02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:33.160
Give me a hand.

02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:40.660
Let's move

02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:42.120
We need to trace them down.

02:15:43.710 --> 02:15:44.960
Hey, give me your phone

02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:14.990
You memorized my cell phone number.

02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:18.030
What's the matter?

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:20.130
I thought you said you'd
never see me again.

02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:22.540
Since when have you been there?

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:25.330
You don't care when I got
here. Just get to the point.

02:16:26.170 --> 02:16:27.330
Yes.

02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.000
I never wanted to see you again.

02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:34.550
But the situation does not
permit us to be backed up.

02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:37.970
Why should I help you? You doubt me.

02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:40.640
That's mean.

02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:43.810
Are you still trying to figure
that out? You're not a baby.

02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:45.810
Well, that's a good idea.

02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:47.480
So what do you want me to do?

02:16:47.730 --> 02:16:49.480
- I'll go.
- Oh, my God.

02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:52.190
Are you going to keep talking like this?

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:54.990
Hurry up and catch them!

02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.870
My fucking phone chief, its brand new.

02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.120
Don't worry.

02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:10.090
I know where they're going.
